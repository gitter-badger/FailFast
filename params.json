{"name":"Failfast","tagline":"Implicit fast fail checks for method contracts in Android","body":"# FailFast\r\n*FailFast* provides implicit contract checks to your methods.\r\n\r\nIntelliJ and Android Studio provide static inspections for methods and parameters annotated with `@NotNull`. When a method is called with a `null` value to a parameter marked as `NotNull`, a warning is presented. \r\n\r\nThis is not enforced however, and `null` can be passed, possibly leading to errors which can be hard to debug. A solution is to check each and every parameter which is annotated as `NotNull`:\r\n\r\n```java\r\npublic void myMethod(@NotNull final String message){\r\n\tif(message == null) {\r\n\t\tthrow new NullPointerException(\"message == null\");\r\n\t}\r\n\r\n\t/* Rest of method */\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis fast fail method is an excellent way to prevent those hard to debug errors. Unfortunately, it requires you writing a lot of code, and it doesn't get your code any cleaner.\r\n\r\n*FailFast* injects these snippets for you compile time, so you don't have to, and your source code stays clean.\r\n\r\n## Usage\r\nJust annotate your methods and parameters with the `@NotNull` annotation, and *FailFast* will do the rest:\r\n\r\n```java\r\n@NotNull\r\npublic String concatenate(@NotNull final String first, @NotNull final String second) {\r\n\treturn first.concat(second);\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nWhenever the `concatenate` method is called with a `null` value, `FailFast` will throw a `NullPointerException`:\r\n\r\n```java\r\nconcatenate(\"Hello\", null);\r\n\r\njava.lang.NullPointerException: Parameter \"second\" of method \"concatenate\" was specified as @NotNull, but null was given.\r\n\tat com.myApp.MyActivity.onCreate(MyActivity.java:19)\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Setup\r\n```groovy\r\nbuildscript {\r\n  repositories {\r\n    mavenCentral()\r\n  }\r\n\r\n  dependencies {\r\n    classpath 'com.nhaarman.failfast:plugin:0.0.1'\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n\r\napply plugin: 'com.android.application'\r\napply plugin: 'com.nhaarman.failfast'\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Supported annotations:\r\n - `org.jetbrains.annotations.NotNull`\r\n - `android.support.annotation.NonNull`\r\n\r\n## Contribute\r\nPlease do!
